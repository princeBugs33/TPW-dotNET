# 🏀 2D Concurrent Ball Simulation

This project is a 2D concurrent ball simulation built with C# and .NET Core, developed as part of a course at TUL (Technical University of Lodz). The main purpose of this project was to explore and implement concurrency in desktop applications, while gaining hands-on experience with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation).
